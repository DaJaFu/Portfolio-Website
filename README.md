# Portfolio Website
 A simple website to host information about me, my accomplishments, and future projects I aim to complete!

 I am a novice Network & Security engineer hoping to find work in the tech sector, but I am faced with a distinct challenge! I do not partake in social media, which limits my ability to put myself out there for recruiters to spot me. My compromise is to use LinkedIn & whatever other social media I deem necessary to point people to my website so they can see what I have to offer while still remaining steadfast in my conviction that social media is toxic.

My goal with this site is to continue to build upon it as a sort of benchmark for my technical capability, as well as my ability to write clean and concise reports on what I learn and do!

I set this up initially to be hosted via an AWS S3 bucket, Route 53 to create the DNS poilicies, and CloudFront to distribute the content securely and effeciently. The HTML & CSS will be completely written by Claude code with my direction, as I do not intend to branch out into front end web development at least from a design standpoint.
